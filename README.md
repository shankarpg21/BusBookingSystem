# BusBookingSystem

A simple java console based application for bus ticket booking where I implemented oops concepts like inheritance and use database for managing the data.

Database is connected using JDBC.

MYSQL is used as database since the project involves structured data.

The admin table consists of adminname and password.

The user table consists of username,password,booking_status,bus_id,bus_name.

The bus table consists of name,src,dest,dest and departure time,availability and classes(AC,SEMI-SLEEPER,SLEEPER,SEATER)

Admin name and user name should maintain as mail-id,bus_id is unique_id since these are acts as primary keys of the respective tables.
